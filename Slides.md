# Differences between base and app?

<div class="grid fs120">
<span class="col-6 border">

  #### Base

  - Designed for working directly with your data.
  - Allows editing and creating database structures.
  - Everyone with access to a base has at least read-only access to all data.
  - Primarily serves as the workspace for owners and collaborators.

</span>
<span class="col-6 border">

  #### App

  - Provides a custom interface tailored to specific data from your base.
  - Enables fine-grained permissions for controlling access to data.
  - Displays only a subset of data relevant to the app's purpose.
  - Can be shared externally without requiring user accounts, making it suitable for customers or business partners.
